# Fuelassist
With increased awareness of environmental protection, volatile resource prices and rising world trade, energy efficiency has become a focal point in international research. While new vehicle propulsion systems, e.g. battery or fuel cell systems, are still in their early stages, it is possible to increase fuel saving and reduce costs by applying a fuel assistant system. Now-a-days everybody wants to have a smooth and uninterruptible journey and also pay little heed to the amount of fuel and the gas stations to reach their destination. This can happen when one can anticipate the fuel quantity before the fuel tank gets devastated.  A vast majority of vehicles owners or drivers don&amp;#39;t keep extra fuel for emergency use when the cars run out of fuel. This leads to interruption during the journey at any place. The person might not have any idea regarding nearby fuel stations in the surroundings of that particular place. Hence a smart fuel assistant system is proposed such that it helps you to find the optimal way to the nearest fuel stations. Based on the amount of fuel available in the vehicle this system guides you to the nearest and best fuel station depending on fuel price, ratings and reviews before the fuel tank gets empty.
